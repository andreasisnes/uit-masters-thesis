First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Robert Molund Pettersen for being awesome. As throughout this last year, your ears had to endure severe pain from my twaddling gibberish-squawking beak. And yet, you managed my fuss until the very end without taking me to the vet and putting me down. I appreciate that you invested so much of your time to help and guide me, but also *whip crack* "encouraging" me to work.

I also want to thank the lords and ladies in my class for making my time as a student... just awesome, cool. I don't know. One thing is for sure, I will never forget all those ridiculous late night hours on the university we have had. There are especially two fellow students I want to express my gratitude to, Sverre Coucheron(ny) and Nikolai Magnussen. You guys, are, just, ok? I guess.

Lastly, I want to thank Ingrid Tiedemann Gjers√∏e for all the cozy weekends with beverages and delicious food. It is surely good to occasionally substitute my everyday Grandiosa with actually nutritious fodder.
